In the Assignment 2 the focus has been on using the SBERT for semantic search and hands-on excerises regarding gradient descent and attention mechanism

In the Assignment 2 part 1 have I performed semantic search using the SBERT model for embedding. Here i have utilized a "Tumbler dataset", uploaded in the same reporsitory with the name "tgif-v1.0"
In the end of Assignment 2 part 1 a gradio has been created which makes it possible to write in the input box and utilizing the semantic search and get a output with GIFs

In Assignment 2 part 2 have I performed hands-on excerises regarding gradient descent and attention mechanisms
In the first section is the focus gradient descent where it has been performed in form of "first" and "second" sample for a dataset
In the second section is the focus attention mechanism where a BERT model has been utilized regarding the embedding of the sentences that has been used in the assignment
